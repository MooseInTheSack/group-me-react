I was debating about sharing this but I really care about all of you guys so I wanted to let you know. \n\nOn Wednesday afternoon I went to Fuego (and only Fuego) and ate a few tacos. Later that night, I began vomiting multiple times and my body temperature was swaying up and down (from sweats to shivers). I even fainted when I got up and tried to get some water. I ended up going to the hospital because I wasn’t very sure what was going on, and I’ve never fainted before in my life. \n\nThey gave me IV fluids and medicine, and then they released me some hours later. Basically, since I vomited so much... I had what is called a “syncope episode”, where your blood pressure drops suddenly to a point that makes you pass out, that is likely caused by food poisoning in my case.

So my group just had a conversation with Sarah. I brought up the idea that dr Us class feels like an undergrad class and is a disproportionate amount of work for the credit hours. Sarah made the comment that they are trying also to integrate a professional writing component, which would  be great except the one professional writing assignment we have is edited by someone else, and like 20 minutes long. The speeches also are a little ridiculous given we won’t need to present these things in real life. Sarah advised us to go to him directly and bring these points and I plan on going this Thursday to bring points up. If anyone feels the same way feel free to join.

Circuit. It’s a really awesome track (average speed throughout a lap is around 156 mph) so it should be a great race. It starts at 8:10 am on Sunday, and I want to invite anyone to come watch at my place! I’ll have breakfast food and stuff for mimosas and we can get up early and watch multi-million dollar cars crash into each other!
